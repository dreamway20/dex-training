              Mexico was treated to a historic farewell on Saturday thanks to
              the country’s first ever overtime thriller that capped off the
              2019 NBA Mexico City Games. Kelly Oubre’s 3-pointer tied the score
              at the end of regulation, then Patty Mills topped it with his
              game-winning jumper with 0.3 seconds left in the extra period to
              give San Antonio the victory. Here’s a look at the most memorable
              sights and moments from the league’s 30th regular season game in
              Mexico City.
