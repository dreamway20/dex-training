            Mexico was treated to a historic farewell on Saturday thanks to the
            country’s first ever overtime thriller that capped off the 2019 NBA
            Mexico City Games. Kelly Oubre’s 3-pointer tied the score at the end
            of regulation, then Patty Mills topped it with his game-winning
            jumper with 0.3 seconds left in the extra period to give San Antonio
            the victory. Here’s a look at the most memorable sights and moments
            from the league’s 30th regular season game in Mexico City.
